Compare it to a swap from Native BTC - Wrapped BTC - Wrapped ETH - Native ETH. You would pay multiple transaction fees using ETH. When you swap to an L1, you pay the outbound gas fee on that chain with a 3x premium.

On those 3x of the gas outbound chain, there is half of that is going to the network and LPs as a \"network fee\" (1.5x) and the outbound transaction has the other half (1.5x) of that fee to use as gas on the chain, so its up to 1.5x the average current gas to make sure its a fast transaction."})})},{title:"What differentiates THORSwap from other interfaces?",content:Object(o.jsx)(s,{children:Object(o.jsx)(a.Label,{size:"big",children:"TLDR: This is your ticket to ASGARD!
