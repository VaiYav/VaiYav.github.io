The\n          other chain’s network fee is out of THORSwaps control and is due to\n          efficiency of their native network. i.e to swap Native BTC to Native\n          ETH directly on THORSwap - you would pay BTC network fee, ETH network\n          fee, and RUNE network fee. Compare it to a swap from Native BTC -\n          Wrapped BTC - Wrapped ETH - Native ETH. You would pay multiple\n          transaction fees using ETH. When you swap to an L1, you pay the\n          outbound gas fee on that chain with a 3x premium.
